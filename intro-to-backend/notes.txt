## CLI vs GUI ##

Based on how we interact with computer, the applications can be divided into two ways:
 
- CLI Command Line Interface
    text based interface where user type command to perfrom tasks
    terminal/console 
    command prompt - Windows
    terminal - Mac/Linux

Nodejs is a CLI application. 


eg.  Git, npm, yt-dlp

- GUI Graphical User Interface
    visual interface where user interact with the system through graphical elements...
    buttons,menus,icons,windows...
    click,drag,drop,scroll
