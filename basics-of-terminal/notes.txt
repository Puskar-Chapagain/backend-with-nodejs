## Introduction to Terminal and Shell ##

when we are deploying our code and making changes to our deployed code
we have to interact with the system through the terminal

few terms :
shells
CLI applications 
    Command Prompt
    Powershells 
    Terminal

Shells 
    Bash 
    zsh(default in Mac)

For Linux command support - we use bash shell

Ctrl ~ - to open the terminal 
Ctrl J - to close the terminal

Terminal can use multiple shells. 
We can understand it like browser(terminal) and multiple tabs(shells)
Each shell has it's own set of commands.

user@PC-name  -- puskar@Puskar

## Basic Shell Commands ##

echo - prints to the terminal
similar to console.log() in JS



pwd - shows the present working directory

whoami - shows the current user

## Navigating File System ##


cd - change directory 
cd .. -> go back to one directory

cd ../../ -> go back two directory

cd 

use tab for suggestion

~ home directory
/ root directory 

## Listing Directory Contents ##

ls 

to view hidden files 
    ls -a 

./ - current directory 
../ - parent directory

to view the file permissions
    ls -al

## Creating, Copying, Moving, and Deleting Files ##

-> to create any file
touch filename.extension

eg. touch index.html style.css script.js 

-> to create a directory
mkdir dirname

eg. mkdir dir1 dir2

-> to copy a file or a directory
cp current-file-path target-file-path

eg. cp app.js src

-> to move a file or a directory
mv current-file-path target-file-path

-> to rename a file
use mv command with new file name 

-> to delete a file 
rm filename

-> to delete a directory 
rmdir dirname -> when the directory is empty 
rm -r dirname -> when the directory is not empty 

rm - f 



when we delete a file from the UI , generally we can recover using Ctrl Z or the recycle 
bin, but when we delete the file from terminal, we can't recover it

Give me a bash command to generate a app1.js app2.js app3.js upto app100.js file

## Viewing and Editing files with Command Line ##

- to view the contents of the file
cat filename

- to edit files 
nano filename
vi filename
vim filename

these are not just commands, they are editors in themselves

I - to switch to insert mode 
Esc - to switch to normal mode

to exit VIM 

:q - exit
:w - save
:q! - exit without save
:wq! - save and exit

when we need to do do changes on our deployment like some quick fix, we use vim in such 
cases.

Vi -Improved  ---> VIM 

## What is a Prompt in terminal ## 

PS - Prompt String
- what we see in the start of the terminal

this is for test push
another test push
